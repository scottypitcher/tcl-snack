Building Snack for MacOS X

In order to use Snack you will have to install Tcl/Tk 8.4.5 or later first.
Download from
http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~steffen/tcltk/TclTkAqua/

In order to build Snack you also need to have Apple's developer tools
installed.

Change directory to unix/ and type

./configure --with-tcl=/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework --with-tk=/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework

Edit the Makefile and specify the Tcl include file directory as

/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Headers

and for the Tk include files

/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Headers

now type

make


Install using:

sudo make install


-------------------------------------------------------------------

MacOS 8.x 9.x
In order to use Snack you will have to install Tcl/Tk 8.3.3 first.

Building Snack using Metrowerks CodeWarrior
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the CodeWarrior project file: snack.mcp.sit.hqx

You will have to specify the location of the Tcl/Tk include files
which are part of the Tcl/Tk source distribution.
This is the default compiler for the Snack Macintosh binaries.


Building Snack using MPW
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Snack can be compiled using Apple's free MPW compiler which can be
downloaded from http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/

You will have to edit the makefile in order to specify the location of the
Tcl/Tk include files which are part of the Tcl/Tk source distribution.


Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You must put the file snack.shlb in the standard library location, 
i.e. the "Tool Command Language" folder within the Extensions folder. 

You have to give Tcl scripts ample memory. This is done by marking the
wish icon and selecting Edit | Show info | Memory. 

You also have to use the 'millions of colors' display setting in order
to get spectrograms to display correctly. Failure to do this will cause
the computer to lock up when running scripts that display spectrograms.
